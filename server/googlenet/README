to run, you need the tensorflow/models git repo.
also, inception_v1_dist.py and inception.py should be moved from 
	requirements/ to models/research/slim/nets, replacing existing files when necessary

it looks like multiple pis are participating, but the automatic placement is putting all computation on worker 0.
might need to write our own placement strategy function.
or, maybe we just need to put the "with tf.device(tf.train.replica_device_setter())" line inside the inception file

also, one pi doesn't see when variables are updated for some reason.
