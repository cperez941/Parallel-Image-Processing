this splits up googlenet between a laptop and a single pi.
it doesn't do so efficiently.
basically, the first half is on the ps task (laptop), and the second half is on the worker task (pi).

next steps would be to scale up and distribute more efficiently.

to run, you need the tensorflow/models git repo.
also, inception_v1_dist.py and inception.py should be moved from 
	other/ to models/research/slim/nets, replacing existing files
	when necessary
